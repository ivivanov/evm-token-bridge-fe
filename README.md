# EVM Token Bridge
>The bridge allows transfers of ERC-20 tokens between two networks. The user should be able to connect to the source chain, select a token and the amount they want to bridge, and select a target chain. There is a predefined service fee for using the bridge that is paid when a bridging transaction is sent. Then the user should be able to receive the tokens on the target chain.
